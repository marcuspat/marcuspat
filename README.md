## 🚀 The Evolution: From Infrastructure to Intelligence

**My Journey:**
```
Linux Systems Admin → DevOps Engineer → Platform Engineer → Agentic Engineer
```

I've spent years building **reliable, scalable infrastructure**. Now I'm applying that same systematic thinking to **AI-powered development**, creating workflows where human expertise and artificial intelligence collaborate to build next-generation applications.

## 🛠️ Core Expertise

### **Platform Engineering Foundation**
- **Linux Systems**: 10+ years of enterprise administration and automation
- **DevOps Pipelines**: CI/CD, infrastructure as code, deployment automation
- **Platform Architecture**: Scalable systems design and reliability engineering
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes, Docker, microservices at scale

### **Agentic Development Innovation**
- **AI Collaboration**: Human-AI workflows using Anthropic Claude, Roo Code
- **SPARC Methodology**: Structured AI-assisted development processes
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Intelligent automation and process optimization
- **System Intelligence**: Building applications that adapt and evolve

## 🎯 What Makes an Agentic Engineer?

**Traditional Engineering:** Human writes code → System executes
**Agentic Engineering:** Human + AI collaborate → Intelligent systems emerge

I combine **infrastructure reliability** with **AI adaptability** to create:
- 🧠 **Self-improving systems** that learn from usage patterns
- ⚡ **Rapid development cycles** (hours instead of weeks)
- 🔧 **Intelligent automation** that handles complexity gracefully
- 📈 **Scalable architectures** designed for AI enhancement

## 💡 Current Focus
